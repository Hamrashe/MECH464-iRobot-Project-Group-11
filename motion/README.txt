This folder is for all functions and scripts related to the motion of the robot.

So far what functions I need are:
	rotate(ang_speed) #rotates the robot at an angular speed of ang_speed [rad/s]
	forward(dist, speed) #moves the robot forward a given distance at a certain speed
	odom() #returns the position and angle of the robot
